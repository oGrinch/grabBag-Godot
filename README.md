# 🎮 Godot Grab Bag

[Prefer to read in Portuguese? 🇧🇷](README.ptbr.md)

Welcome to my Godot Grab Bag — a collection of everything I'm learning about Godot, from small exercises to mini projects.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo exists so I can:

- **Get better at Godot** by practicing with real examples and projects  
- **Keep everything organized** in one place as I learn  
- **Build a portfolio** of small projects to show what I can do  
- **Track my progress** as I grow as a game developer

---

## 🚀 Running the Projects

To try out any of the projects here, just make sure you have **Godot Engine** installed — ideally the latest version (Godot 3.x or 4.x).  
This repository's projects are primarily developed using Godot and are fully compatible with its environment.
